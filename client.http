Subject: Clarification on Offer Letter and Management Approach



I hope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base regarding a couple of matters that have been on my mind. Firstly, I want to express my appreciation for the chance to be a part of the team here at [Company Name] for the past month. It's been an insightful experience, and I'm eager to contribute further.

I was hoping to discuss the status of my official offer letter. As I approach my one-month mark with [Company Name], having a formal offer letter in place would provide clarity on my role and the expectations moving forward.

Also, I wanted to share some thoughts about the management style. While I appreciate the flexibility in our work environment, I believe a bit more structure in certain aspects would streamline our efforts. Clearer lines of communication and well-defined expectations could enhance our team's efficiency and collaboration.

I value your insights and would greatly appreciate the opportunity to chat about these topics. Could we possibly schedule a brief Skype call to address these points? Your guidance would be extremely helpful as I continue to integrate into the team.

Thank you for your time and consideration. Looking forward to our discussion.
